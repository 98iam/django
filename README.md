## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and available:

- **Python 3.8+** - The programming language used

- **Google Gemini API Key** - For the AI chat assistant feature (get it from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/))
- **Git** - For cloning the repository
- **pip** - Python package manager
- **virtualenv** - Recommended for creating isolated Python environments

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/inventory-management.git
cd inventory-management

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy example environment file and edit with your values
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database credentials and Gemini API key

# Run migrations
python manage.py migrate

# Create superuser
python manage.py createsuperuser

# Collect static files
python manage.py collectstatic

# Start development server
python manage.py runserver
```

Then visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

- Google Generative AI (Gemini) for AI chat assistant

## Environment Configuration

The `.env` file should contain the following variables:

```
# Django settings
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here

# Database settings
DB_NAME=your_db_name
DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_HOST=your_db_host
DB_PORT=5432

# Gemini API settings
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
# Uncomment and set this if you want to specify a particular model
# GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-1.5-flash
```

## Database Setup

This project uses PostgreSQL with Supabase by default, but you can modify the settings in your `.env` file to use any database supported by Django:

- For **SQLite** (simple local development):
  ```
  # No additional settings needed, Django will use SQLite by default if PostgreSQL is not configured
  ```

- For **PostgreSQL** (recommended for production):
  ```
  DB_NAME=your_db_name
  DB_USER=your_db_user
  DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
  DB_HOST=your_db_host
  DB_PORT=5432
  ```

- For **Supabase** (as used in this project):
  1. Create a Supabase account at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com/)
  2. Create a new project and get your database credentials
  3. Add them to your `.env` file as shown above

## Usage

1. Access the admin interface at `http://localhost:8000/admin`
2. Log in with your credentials
3. Start managing your inventory!

### Using the AI Chat Assistant

1. Make sure you've set up your Gemini API key in the `.env` file
2. Click on the robot icon in the navigation bar to open the chat sidebar
3. Create a new chat session or select an existing one
4. Type your questions about inventory management or how to use the system
5. You can chat directly in the sidebar or open the chat in a full page by clicking the menu (â‹®) and selecting "Open in full page"

## AI Chat Assistant

The system includes an AI chat assistant powered by Google Gemini:

1. **Setup**:
   - Get a Google Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
   - Add your API key to the `.env` file: `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`
   - By default, the system uses the `gemini-1.5-flash` model
   - Optionally specify a different model: `GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-1.5-pro`

2. **Features**:
   - Chat with the AI assistant about inventory management
   - Get help with using the system
   - Create multiple chat sessions
   - View chat history
   - Rename and delete chat sessions

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues

- If you're having trouble connecting to PostgreSQL, make sure your database credentials are correct in the `.env` file
- For local development, you can switch to SQLite by removing or commenting out the database settings in your `.env` file

### AI Chat Assistant Issues

- If the AI chat is not working, check that your Gemini API key is valid and correctly set in the `.env` file
- Make sure you have internet access as the AI chat requires API calls to Google's servers
- If you get model-related errors, try specifying a different model by uncommenting and setting the `GEMINI_MODEL` variable in your `.env` file

### Static Files Not Loading

- Make sure you've run `python manage.py collectstatic`
- Check that `DEBUG=True` in your `.env` file during development
